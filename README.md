# Saga Music

Our official Android app is now open-source.

## Hello

It was really hard to download music for free. You search for songs, open different websites, hide from fake links and tackle popups, and you still canâ€™t find it in good quality most of the times. We had the same problem, and so we decided to fix it.

We've tried to simplify the process of downloading music from the web and turn in into a beautiful experience. You can use Saga Music to download unlimited songs for free, using YouTube, the most popular source for music.

## Eplilogue
I conceptualized Saga Music because music downloading was very hard, and my mother and brother always asked me to download songs for them; there had to be a better way. Saga Music 2015-2016, all good things must come to an end. I'd like to thank our incredible [contrbutors](https://github.com/SagaMusic/saga-android/graphs/contributors) who made this project possible, especially [Prempal Singh](https://github.com/prempalsingh), who single handedly developed the entire Android app. Thank you for building the most beautiful music downloading experience. Signing off,

Anand Chowdhary
